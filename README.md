# TheSuperQuestionTypeTopicClassifier
There has not been much work done on this topic in the Persian language so the resulting tool will be quite useful in Persian Q&A websites. Machine Learning techniques are used here to determine the type and the category of questions so they can be more easily tagged and classified. Also identifying the question type can be very helpful in further NLP tasks such as summarization.

Further description of the project will be added soon...
